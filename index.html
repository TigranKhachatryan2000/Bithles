            <h2> About the band </h2>
            <p> The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960, that comprised John Lennon, Paul
                McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They are regarded as the most influential band of all
                time and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as
                an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of
                classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging
                from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and
                artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often
                publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.

            <p> By early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical
                and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the
                British Invasion of the United States pop market, and soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night
                (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the untenable nature of their
                concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. At this time, they produced
                records of greater sophistication, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt.
                Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also
                known as "the White Album", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). Heralding the album era, their success elevated
                the album to the dominant form of record consumption over singles; they also inspired a greater public
                interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music,
                album art and music videos. In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that
                continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all
                principal members enjoyed success as solo artists and some partial reunions have occurred. Lennon was
                murdered in 1980 and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.
